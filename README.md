## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jordanaftermidnight/Practical-Task-P2.git
cd Practical-Task-P2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Complete Demonstration
```bash
python examples/complete_demonstration.py
```

This will:
1. 🤖 Generate the "simulation proof" showing impossible image multiplication
2. 📊 Scrape data from multiple sources and perform NumPy analysis
3. 📈 Create comprehensive visualizations
4. 📋 Print detailed analysis reports

### Individual Task Examples

#### Task 1: Simulation Proof
```python
from src.image_processing import SimulationProof

# Create the simulation proof
sim_proof = SimulationProof(image_size=(200, 300))
original_image = sim_proof.create_test_image("dog_silhouette")
strips = sim_proof.shred_image(strip_width=15)

# Generate the "impossible" effects
sequence = sim_proof.create_simulation_proof_sequence()
analysis = sim_proof.analyze_simulation_evidence(sequence)

# Visualize the "proof"
sim_proof.visualize_proof(sequence, save_path="simulation_proof.png")
sim_proof.print_simulation_report(analysis)
```

#### Task 2: Data Analysis
```python
from src.data_analysis import WebScraper, NumpyAnalytics

# Scrape data
scraper = WebScraper()
data = scraper.collect_all_data()

# Perform NumPy analysis
analytics = NumpyAnalytics()
results = analytics.comprehensive_analysis(data)

# Print detailed report
analytics.print_analysis_report(results)
analytics.create_visualizations(data, results, save_path="analysis.png")
```

## 📊 Data Sources & Analysis

The project scrapes and analyzes data from multiple domains:

- **Weather Data**: Temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed across cities

- **Cryptocurrency**: Prices, market caps, 24h volumes, price changes
- **Demographics**: Population, GDP per capita, life expectancy, literacy rates
- **Sports Statistics**: Player performance metrics

### NumPy Operations Demonstrated

**Required Operations:**
- ✅ **Mean/Average**: `np.mean()` across all datasets
- ✅ **Sum**: `np.sum()` for aggregations and energy analysis
